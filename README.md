# OAuth2
Testing and building a Java OAuth2 stack using (legacy) Spring Security OAuth2

## Modules
This project is made up out of several modules. The following is small description of what each module contains:
- `Baeldung` - All the information I could scrape from the [Baeldung website](https://www.baeldung.com/). This was done using the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) as well as the [Baeldung GitHub repo](https://github.com/Baeldung/spring-security-oauth/).
- `Baeldung new stack` - The new Spring Security 5 stack [deprecated the old OAuth2 Authorization Server](https://spring.io/blog/2019/11/14/spring-security-oauth-2-0-roadmap-update). This new stack is using a build-in KeyCloak server instead.
